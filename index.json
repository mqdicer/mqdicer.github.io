The pay-it-forward strategy offers an individual a gift (eg, a test for sexually transmitted diseases) and then asks whether they would like to give a gift (eg, a future test) to another person. This study examined the effectiveness of a pay-it-forward programme to increase gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing among MSM in China. METHODS: We did a randomised controlled superiority trial at three HIV testing sites run by MSM community-based organisations in Guangzhou and Beijing, China. We included MSM aged 16 years or older who were seeking HIV testing and met indications for gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing. Restricted randomisation was done using computer-generated permuted blocks. 30 groups were randomised into three arms (1:1:1): a pay-it-forward arm in which men were offered free gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing and then asked whether they would like to donate for testing of prospective participants, a pay-what-you-want arm in which men were offered free testing and given the option to pay any desired amount for the test, and a standard-of-care arm in which testing was offered at yen150 (US$22). There was no masking to arm assignment. The primary outcome was gonorrhoea and chlamydia test uptake ascertained by administrative records. We used generalised estimating equations to estimate intervention effects with one-sided 95% CIs and a prespecified superiority margin of 20%. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03741725. FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2018, and Jan 19, 2019, 301 men were recruited and included in the analysis. 101 were randomly assigned to the pay-it-forward group, 100 to the pay-what-you- want group, and 100 to the standard-of-care group. Test uptake for gonorrhoea and chlamydia was 56% (57 of 101 participants) in the pay-it- forward arm, 46% (46 of 100 participants) in the pay-what-you-want arm, and 18% (18 of 100 participants) in the standard-of-care arm. The estimated difference in test uptake between the pay-it-forward and standard-of-care group was 38.4% (95% CI lower bound 28.4%). Among men in the pay-it-forward arm, 54 of 57 (95%) chose to donate to support testing for others. INTERPRETATION: The pay-it-forward strategy can increase gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing uptake among Chinese MSM and could be a useful tool for scaling up preventive services that carry a mandatory fee.

We developed a pay-it- forward program where men receive a free gonorrhea/chlamydia test and can then donate toward future participants' tests. This study aims to investigate drivers of testing uptake and donation using a mixed methods approach. METHODS: We used a sequential explanatory design to explore drivers of testing uptake and donation unique to pay-it-forward through a quantitative cross-sectional survey and a qualitative thematic analysis of semistructured interviews. We collected data on sociodemographics and perceived benefits of pay-it-forward among men offered the pay-it-forward interventionand analyzed testing uptake and donations using descriptive statistics and logistic regression. We then conducted 30 semistructured interviews with men and coded interview data to identify themes. RESULTS: Three hundred and one MSM were offered pay-it-forward and 55% (165/301) received gonorrhea/chlamydia testing. Ninety-one percent (150 of 165) donated any amount with a mean of 58.31 +/- 53.39 RMB (US $8.61 +/- 7.88), or 39% of the standard price of gonorrhea/chlamydia testing. Getting tested was not associated with income, but donations were higher in the highest income bracket (adjusted odds ratio, 7.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.61-31.52). Fifty-eight percent (94 of 162) selected \\\"more MSM can get tested,\\\" and 54% (88 of 162) selected \\\"I can help someone else\\\" as benefits of pay-it-forward. Qualitative themes for drivers of testing and donation included flexible pricing, generosity and reciprocity, and MSM community identity. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that this pay-it-forward program may increase gonorrhea/chlamydia testing by reducing cost barriers, leveraging generosity and reciprocity, and mobilizing community altruism.","tags":[],"title":"A Secondary Mixed Methods Analysis of a Pay-it-Forward Gonorrhea/Chlamydia Testing Program Among Men Who Have Sex With Men in China.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Navin Kumar","Laura Forastiere","Tiange Zhang","Fan Yang","Katherine T.

MSM do not frequently receive rectal STI testing because of several barriers, such as not being out (disclosure of sexual behavior). We evaluate whether Chinese MSM select an STI test (rectal vs urethral) appropriate for their sexual behavior (insertive and/or receptive), and the interactions with being out. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data from a cross sectional MSM survey conducted at a multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) (December 2018 to January 2019) around uptake of gonorrhea and chlamydia testing among Chinese MSM (N = 431). We collected socio demographics, relevant medical and sexual history, and disclosure of sexual behavior (outness). We estimated the decision to test and test choice, and the extent to which disclosure plays a role in decision making. RESULTS: Among 431 MSM, mean age was 28 years (SD = 7.10) and 65% were out to someone. MSM who indicated versatile sexual behavior and were out to someone had a 26.8% (95%CI = 6.1, 47.5) increased likelihood for selecting the rectal test vs the ure thral test, compared to those versatile and not out. Versatile MSM out to their health provider outside of the study context had a 29.4% (95%CI = 6.3, 52.6) greater likelihood for selecting the rectal STI test vs the urethral test, compared to versatile MSM not out to their health provider. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual behavior and outness may affect gonorrhea and chlamydia testing provision. Apart from clinicians, community based efforts may reduce stigma based barriers to testing.","tags":["\"*Social Stigma\"","\"Adult\"","\"China\"","\"China/epidemiology\"","\"Cross-Sectional Studies\"","\"Disclosure/*statistics \u0026 numerical data\"","\"Homosexuality\"","\"Male/*statistics \u0026 numerical data\"","\"Humans\"","\"Male\"","\"MSM\"","\"Prevalence\"","\"Sexual behavior disclosure\"","\"Sexual Behavior/*statistics \u0026 numerical data\"","\"Sexual health\"","\"Sexually Transmitted Diseases/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology\"","\"Young Adult\""],"title":"Lack of sexual behavior disclosure may distort STI testing outcomes.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sage K.

However, less was known about whether mindfulness meditation might alter pro-social behavior. Here we examined whether mindfulness meditation activates human altruism, a component of social cooperation. Using a simple donation game, which is a real-world version of the Dictator's Game, we randomly assigned 326 subjects to a mindfulness meditation online session or control and measured their willingness to donate a portion of their payment for participation as a charitable donation. Subjects who underwent the meditation treatment donated at a 2.61 times higher rate than the control (p = 0.005), after controlling for socio-demographics. We also found a larger treatment effect of meditation among those who did not go to college (p textless 0.001) and those who were under 25 years of age (p textless 0.001), with both subject groups contributing virtually nothing in the control condition. Our results imply high context modularity of human altruism and the development of intervention approaches including mindfulness meditation to increase social cooperation, especially among subjects with low baseline willingness to contribute.","tags":["\"*Altruism\"","\"*Social Behavior\"","\"Adult\"","\"Anxiety/psychology\"","\"Charities\"","\"Emotions/*physiology\"","\"Female\"","\"Humans\"","\"Male\"","\"Meditation/*psychology\"","\"Mindfulness/methods\"","\"Video Games/psychology\""],"title":"Mindfulness Meditation Activates Altruism.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akihiro Nishi","Marcus Alexander","James H.

Genetic assortative mating has been documented in humans, but its existence beyond population stratification (shared ancestry) has been a matter of controversy. Here, we develop a method to measure assortative mating across the genome at 1,044,854 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), controlling for population stratification and cohort-specific cryptic relatedness. Using data on 1683 human couples from two data sources, we find evidence for both assortative and disassortative mating at specific, discernible loci throughout the entire genome. Then, using the composite of multiple signals (CMS) score, we also show that the group of SNPs exhibiting the most assortativity has been under stronger recent positive selection. Simulations using realistic inputs confirm that assortative mating might indeed affect changes in allele frequency over time.

A quasi-experimental study suggested that a pay-it-forward strategy increased dual gonorrhea/chlamydia testing among MSM. Pay-it-forward offers an individual a gift (e.g., a free test) and then asks the same person if they would like to give a gift to another person. This article reports the protocol of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate dual gonorrhea/chlamydia test uptake and other outcomes among MSM in three arms - a pay-it-forward arm, a pay- what-you-want arm, and a standard of care arm. METHODS: Three hundred MSM will be recruited at three HIV testing sites in Guangzhou and Beijing. Testing sites include two hospital-based MSM sexually transmitted diseases clinics and one MSM community-based organization. Eligible participants will be born biologically male, aged 16 years or older, reporting previous anal sex with another man, having never participated in the pay-it-forward program, without previous gonorrhea and chlamydia testing in the past 12 months, and residing in China. Following a cluster randomized design, every cluster of ten participants will be randomly allocated into one of three arms: (1) a pay-it-forward arm in which men are offered free gonorrhea and chlamydia testing and then asked whether they would like to donate (\\\"pay it forward\\\") toward testing for future testers; (2) a pay-what-you-want arm in which men are offered free testing and told to decide how much to pay after receiving the test; (3) a standard of care arm in which men can pay the full price for dual gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing. The primary outcome is dual gonorrhoea/chlamydia testing as verified by administrative records. Secondary outcomes include incremental cost per test, incremental cost per diagnosis, community connectedness, and social cohesion. Primary outcome will be calculated for each arm using intention-to-treat and compared using one-sided 95% confidence intervals with a margin of 20% increase defined as superiority. DISCUSSION: This study will examine the pay-it-forward strategy in comparison to the standard of care in improving test uptake for gonorrhea and chlamydia. We will leverage the cluster randomized controlled trial to provide scientific evidence on the potential effect of pay-it-forward. Findings from this study will shed light on novel intervention methods for increasing preventive health service utilization and innovate ways to finance it among communities.

We argue that current research has failed to properly account for the institutional environment and how it affects the role diversity plays. The emergence of thriving, diverse communities throughout human history suggests that diversity does not always lead to cooperation breakdown. We conducted experiments in Mostar, Bosnia- Herzegovina with Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks at a critical historic moment in the city's postwar history. Using a public goods game, we found that the ability to sanction is key to achieving cooperation in ethno-religiously diverse groups, but that sanctions succeed only in integrated institutional environments and fail in segregated ones. Hence, we show experimentally for the first time in a real-life setting that institutions of integration can unleash human altruism and restore cooperation in the presence of diversity.","tags":["\"*Altruism\"","\"*Cooperative Behavior\"","\"*Cultural Diversity\"","\"*Group Processes\"","\"Bosnia and Herzegovina\"","\"Catholicism\"","\"Conflict\"","\"Psychological\"","\"Female\"","\"Games\"","\"Experimental\"","\"Humans\"","\"Islam\"","\"Male\"","\"Punishment\"","\"Research Design\"","\"Schools/*organization \u0026 administration\""],"title":"Context modularity of human altruism.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander","Matthew Harding"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618369978,"objectID":"a680d3c91dac4cdda820f54425f0b44f","permalink":"https://mqdicer.github.io/publication/alexander-quantifying-2011/","publishdate":"2021-04-14T03:12:58.422741Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alexander-quantifying-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Quantifying the impact of economic crises on infant mortality in advanced economies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander","Matthew Harding","Carlos Lamarche"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618369978,"objectID":"09564f72898382c8f9ccc2a791681ccf","permalink":"https://mqdicer.github.io/publication/alexander-quantile-2011/","publishdate":"2021-04-14T03:12:58.280078Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alexander-quantile-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Quantile Regression for Time-Series-Cross-Section Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles S.

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnosis and course of treatment of hand disorders between patients with Workers' Compensation insurance and patients with standard insurance. METHODS: The complete medical records of patients who visited an academic orthopaedic hand clinic between January 2005 and January 2007 were reviewed, and information on patient history, utilization of diagnostic tests, diagnosis, surgery, and wait- time to surgery was collected. Patients with Workers' Compensation insurance and those with other, third-party coverage were analyzed and compared. Patients without insurance were excluded from this study. RESULTS: 1413 patients (representing 2121 diagnoses) were included in the study. One hundred and sixteen patients (8%) had Workers' Compensation insurance and 1297 patients (92%) had standard insurance. Patients with Workers' Compensation insurance were younger than patients with standard insurance (mean age, forty-three years compared with fifty years, respectively; p textless 0.05) and were also more likely to be male (50% compared with 40%, respectively; p = 0.04). Generally, Workers' Compensation patients more often had neurological conditions (p textless 0.01), but there was no significant difference in the most common diagnoses between the two groups. Patients with Workers' Compensation underwent surgery slightly more often than did patients with standard insurance (44% compared with 35%, respectively; p = 0.07) and had a higher average number of visits before undergoing surgery (2.3 visits compared with 1.2 visits, respectively; p textless 0.05). Twenty-three (45%) of the fifty-one patients with Workers' Compensation insurance who received a diagnosis indicating the need for surgery underwent surgery after the first visit, compared with 316 (69%) of 458 patients with standard insurance (p textless 0.05). Patients with Workers' Compensation insurance were more likely than patients with standard insurance to undergo electrodiagnostic testing (26% compared with 15%, respectively; p textless 0.01) or magnetic resonance imaging (16% compared with 9%, respectively; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients receiving standard insurance, patients receiving Workers' Compensation insurance have a greater number of clinic visits before undergoing surgery and receive more diagnostic testing. More research is needed to explore these differences and their potential clinical and economic consequences.","tags":["\"Adult\"","\"Female\"","\"Hand Injuries/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*surgery\"","\"Humans\"","\"Insurance\"","\"Health/economics\"","\"Male\"","\"Smoking/epidemiology\"","\"United States/epidemiology\"","\"Workers' Compensation/*economics\"","\"Wrist Injuries/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*surgery\""],"title":"Effects of workers' compensation on the diagnosis and surgical treatment of patients with hand and wrist disorders.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander","D.

This pattern of flexion-extension and radial-ulnar deviation coupling is vital in common tasks; however, its evaluation in hand clinics is limited by the availability and ease of current tools. We present the construct, criterion, test-retest, and inter-rater validity of a new circumduction measurement device. METHODS: Splint volunteers (n = 42) and hand clinic patients (n = 51) were studied to assess different aspects of validity and reliability for the circumduction jig. Known-group validation was used to assess construct validity and demonstrate the ability of the device to differentiate between patients with lesser or greater circumduction values. Criterion validity was demonstrated by comparing the circumduction measures of the device to flexion, extension, ulnar deviation, and radial deviation. Test-retest reliability was established by comparing the results of repeated circumduction measures for the hand clinic patients by 2 blinded, independent researchers, and inter-rater reliability was determined by evaluating the correlation in circumduction measures taken on the same patient by different blinded, independent researchers. RESULTS: Circumduction measurements significantly decreased (test for trend, p textless .01) across the 3 different treatments that represented progressively reduced range of motion, establishing construct validity of the device. Flexion, extension, and radioulnar deviation all correlated significantly with circumduction; the correlation values ranged from 0.46 to 0.82 (p textless .01) among all subjects (93 subjects, 228 measurements). Intra-rater reliability was 0.98 (p textless .01) for both evaluators, and inter-rater reliability was 0.94 (p textless .01).

We provide the first empirical characterization of physicians loss functions. We find that even the physicians subjective belief distributions over outcomes are not well calibrated, with the loss characterized by asymmetry in favor of over-predicting patients' survival. We show that the physicians' bias is further increased by (1) reduction of the belief distributions to point forecasts, (2) communication of the forecast to the patient, and (3) physicians own past experience and reputation.","tags":["\"*Behavior\"","\"*Bias\"","\"*Physicians\"","\"*Survivors\"","\"Aged\"","\"Aged\"","\"80 and over\"","\"Chicago\"","\"Cohort Studies\"","\"Female\"","\"Humans\"","\"Male\"","\"Middle Aged\"","\"Models\"","\"Statistical\"","\"Prognosis\"","\"Prospective Studies\"","\"Reproducibility of Results\""],"title":"Bias and asymmetric loss in expert forecasts: a study of physician prognostic behavior with respect to patient survival.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618369980,"objectID":"75af1dbf449c355e3c67781d6c033d6b","permalink":"https://mqdicer.github.io/publication/alexander-death-2008/","publishdate":"2021-04-14T03:13:00.071058Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alexander-death-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Death and Politics: How Partisanship and Inequality Shape Health in the OECD.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618369979,"objectID":"aaeb6cb9a8ebaa10a67c70032bebdd91","permalink":"https://mqdicer.github.io/publication/alexander-democratization-2008/","publishdate":"2021-04-14T03:12:59.760749Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alexander-democratization-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Democratization and Hybrid Regimes: Comparative Evidence from Southeast Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander","Matthew Harding","Carlos Lamarche"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618369980,"objectID":"e92a9f8023d48068e434c0fbdf036362","permalink":"https://mqdicer.github.io/publication/alexander-political-2008/","publishdate":"2021-04-14T03:12:59.921767Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alexander-political-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Political Economy of Heterogenous Development: Quantile Effects of Income and Education","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander","Reshma Kewalramani","Irene Agodoa","Denise Globe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1196467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618369980,"objectID":"d64f2e59934ba619c6e8253ad37b64f8","permalink":"https://mqdicer.github.io/publication/alexander-association-2007/","publishdate":"2021-04-14T03:13:00.215284Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alexander-association-2007/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE: This was an open-label study to asses the association of changes in hemoglobin with changes in health related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients treated with darbepoetin alfa. METHODS: Originally, 81 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients not on dialysis and naive to erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) were randomly assigned into two open-label groups (3 : 1). As a majority of control group patients opted out of control status, this study reports on the single arm study analysis that was performed on the 48 patients who received the drug through week 16. Sixty-two patients received once-weekly darbepoetin alfa in addition to conservative management for CKD. Instruments that measured general (SF-36, FACTanemia, FACT-fatigue, ADL and IADL) and disease specific (KDQOL) HRQOL domains were administered at baseline and after 8, 16, and 24 weeks. RESULTS: Compared to baseline values, mean HRQOL subscales were significantly improved in the treatment group at 16 weeks (p textless 0.05 for SF-36 physical function; p textless 0.001 for SF-36 vitality, FACT anemia and FACT fatigue scales). At week 16, the SF-36 mean increase for 48 treatment patients in the Vitality Subscale Score was 14.9 (SD 3.2) and the mean increase in the KDQOL Burden of Kidney Disease Subscale was 5.5 (SD 3.3). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated a statistically significant association (p textless 0.05) between hemoglobin levels and higher HRQOL scores on several physical function, energy and fatigue scales. CONCLUSION: Improvements in hemoglobin in CKD patients not on dialysis were associated with statistically significant (p textless 0.05), clinically meaningful (textgreater 5 points) HRQOL improvements on scales measuring physical activity, vitality and fatigue. Our study did not show an association between increased hemoglobin levels and other aspects of HRQOL, such as those relating to emotional status, sexual activity or cognition. The interpretation of our results is limited by the lack of a control arm to assess whether conservative therapy for CKD, in the absence of ESA administration, would have a comparable effect on patients' HRQOL scores. Further research needs to examine whether other aspects of HRQOL improve with anemia treatment, in the same way as those aspects of HRQOL more closely related to physical activity and fatigue.","tags":["\"*Quality of Life\"","\"Adolescent\"","\"Adult\"","\"Anemia/*drug therapy/etiology\"","\"Darbepoetin alfa\"","\"Erythropoietin/*analogs \u0026 derivatives/therapeutic use\"","\"Female\"","\"Hematinics/*therapeutic use\"","\"Hemoglobins/analysis\"","\"Humans\"","\"Kidney Failure\"","\"Chronic/*complications\"","\"Male\"","\"Middle Aged\"","\"Renal Dialysis\"","\"Treatment Outcome\""],"title":"Association of anemia correction with health related quality of life in patients not on dialysis.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618369980,"objectID":"06eb366d8a7488cc4d65234dca9bb15e","permalink":"https://mqdicer.github.io/publication/alexander-determinants-2007/","publishdate":"2021-04-14T03:13:00.364379Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alexander-determinants-2007/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Determinants of Social Capital: New Evidence on Religion, Diversity and Structural Change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander","Mattthew Harding"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618369980,"objectID":"bd03f5a411ccfac6e32121666040bc48","permalink":"https://mqdicer.github.io/publication/alexander-is-2006/","publishdate":"2021-04-14T03:13:00.510792Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alexander-is-2006/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Is Poverty to Blame for Civil War?

NaN is a recently described tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channel expressed preferentially in IB4-labeled dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We employed an antibody raised to a NaN specific peptide to show that NaN is preferentially localized along axons of IB4-positive unmyelinated fibers in the sciatic nerve and in axon terminals in the cornea. NaN immunoreactivity was also found at some nodes of Ranvier of thinly myelinated axons of the sciatic nerve, where it was juxtaposed to Kv1.2 potassium channel immunoreactivity. This distribution of NaN is consistent with a role for NaN sodium channels in nociceptive transmission.","tags":["\"Amino Acid Sequence\"","\"Animals\"","\"Axons/drug effects/ultrastructure\"","\"Cornea/innervation\"","\"Female\"","\"Ganglia\"","\"Spinal/drug effects/ultrastructure\"","\"Image Processing\"","\"Computer-Assisted\"","\"Immunohistochemistry\"","\"Molecular Sequence Data\"","\"Myelin Sheath/physiology\"","\"NAV1.9 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel\"","\"Nerve Fibers/physiology/ultrastructure\"","\"Neurons\"","\"Afferent/drug effects/ultrastructure\"","\"Neuropeptides/*drug effects\"","\"Nociceptors/*drug effects\"","\"Presynaptic Terminals/physiology/ultrastructure\"","\"Ranvier's Nodes/physiology/ultrastructure\"","\"Rats\"","\"Rats\"","\"Sprague-Dawley\"","\"Sciatic Nerve/physiology/ultrastructure\"","\"Sodium Channels/*drug effects\"","\"Tetrodotoxin/*pharmacology\""],"title":"Localization of the tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channel NaN in nociceptors.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://mqdicer.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
